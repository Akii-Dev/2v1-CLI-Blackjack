# 2v1-CLI-Blackjack
A commandline version of Blackjack where 2 players play individually against a dealer.

This is a schoolproject from November 2022 reuploaded to GitHub.

## Rules
- The 2 players play against the dealer individually. The player wins against the dealer if the player has a higher score than them.
- If the score of the dealer is equal or higher to that of the player, the dealer wins.
- If a player starts their hand with a Blackjack, they will instantly win and the game will stop for everyone.
- The dealer will always grab a card if their score is lower than 18.
- A player may choose not to draw a card and their score will be fixed preventing them from drawing a card again for the remainder of the game.
- If a player draws 5 times consecutively they will recieve a "Five Card Charlie" and win the game.
- When the dealer gets busted, everyone who is still in the game will win regardless of their score.



## How to play
- Use index.php to start the game.
- After you get your openinghand, type "d" or "draw" to draw a card.
- If you do not want to draw a card type "stop".
- Everyone takes turns starting with the dealer. So player 1 starts.
- The game will continue until everyone stops drawing cards or if a game ending scenario has occured. After which the scores will be compared.
